# DNS Hackathon 2023 - Connect to port 53!

During May 20-21 (the weekend before [#RIPE86](https://ripe86.ripe.net/)), 42+ hackers gathered from all corners of the world to work on DNS with the challenges of; Sustainability, Security (& Privacy) and Sovereignty.

The results were also presented during the [DNS Working Group at RIPE86](https://ripe86.ripe.net/programme/meeting-plan/dns-wg/), check [slides](https://ripe86.ripe.net/wp-content/uploads/presentations/124-port53-hackathon-dns-oops-spuaur5ebpbb3g67hs3fms1epy.pdf) and [video recordings](https://ripe86.ripe.net/archives/video/1082).
